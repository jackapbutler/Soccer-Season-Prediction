# Soccer-Season-Prediction
To summarise, I used a Poisson Generalised Linear Model to predict goals scored in a certain fixture. This is because the goals scored in a 90 minute soccer match is approximately distrbuted by a Poisson distribution as we can see below. I fitted this model to season 1 results and then used this model to predict season 2.
